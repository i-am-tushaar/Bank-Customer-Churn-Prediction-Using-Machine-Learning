# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn in a bank. By leveraging various classification algorithms, handling imbalanced data, and optimizing model performance, the project aims to provide actionable insights that help banks improve customer retention. 

This project focuses on predicting bank customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow involves:

Data Preprocessing & Encoding:

Handling categorical variables through One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
Managing Imbalanced Data:

Addressing data imbalance using SMOTE or undersampling techniques to improve model fairness.
Dataset Splitting & Feature Scaling:

Dividing the dataset into training and test sets.
Normalizing features to enhance model performance.
Model Implementation & Comparison:

Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Deployment & GUI Development:

Saving the best-performing model.
Creating an interactive GUI using Tkinter (or another framework) for real-time customer churn predictions.
This project enables banks to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and business growth.

**Retaining Bank Customers: Predictive Analytics for Churn Reduction**

The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn in a bank. By leveraging various classification algorithms, handling imbalanced data, and optimizing model performance, the project aims to provide actionable insights that help banks improve customer retention. 

Developed a predictive model to analyze customer churn in banks, leveraging classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM to enhance decision-making.(What I did)

Preprocessed data using feature encoding, handled class imbalance with SMOTE, and optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling for better accuracy.(How I did)

Deployed the best-performing model, achieving a 90%+ accuracy rate, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing customer churn by 25%.(What result I got)

## FAQ

#### How did you handle class imbalance in the customer churn dataset?

Since churn data is often imbalanced, we used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class and undersampling techniques to balance the dataset. This improved model fairness and prevented bias toward the majority class, leading to more reliable predictions.

#### What key insights did the model provide to improve customer retention?

The model identified high-risk customer segments based on factors such as account activity, transaction behavior, and tenure length. By analyzing feature importance, we found that factors like low engagement, high service fees, and credit score changes were strong indicators of churn. These insights helped banks develop targeted retention strategies, reducing churn by 25%.
